    <title>Keithley's next bike</title>
      <h1>What's next?</h1>
    <h2>I always want a new bike. Here's a few that have caught my eye.</h2>
    </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Honda</h1>
      <p>Being real, I'm a Honda guy. I've had several, and though 
        I think many of their bikes are hideous, I like a lot of them.</p>
     <h2>Honda Fury 1300</h2>
      <p>
        I originally thought that the Fury was ugly
        and a bad attempt of breaking into an industry
        sector that was dying out anyway. The success of Discovery Channel shows about bike builders
        brought on this atrocity, but as I get older I see
        the Fury as a reliable, cheap way to get a tough
        looking bike, with the help of a hacksaw of course.
      </p>
    <h2>Honda CB1100</h2>
      <p>
        You've seen my '71 CB500, so you know I like that old flat, Universal Japanese Motorcycle look. I was stoked when they
        created the new CB1100 with bits of that old style yet with an updated motor. Now if only I can ride one without 
        the hip pain that by old CB gave me.
    </p>
    <h2>Honda Rebel 500</h2>
      <p>
        I never thought I'd be interested in a Rebel, but these new ones look fun.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Harley</h1>
      <p>I'll need to get a garage first.</p>
    <h2>Softail Springer</h2>
      <p>
        A long Softail with a springer front. It doesn't need any chrome because I'm not
         going to keep it clean anyway.
      </p>
    <h2>Dyna Wide Glide</h2>
      <p>This is my backup bike if I can't afford the Softail. Actually, I'd try to get a 
        Softail with Wide Glide front forks if I can't get the Springer, 
        then next would be the Dyna.
