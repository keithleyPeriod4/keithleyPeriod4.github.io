    <h1>Honda</h1>
      <p>Being real, I'm a Honda guy. I've had several, and though I think many of their bikes are hideous, I like a lot of them</p>
     <h2>Honda Fury 1300</h2>
      <p>I originally thought that the Fury was ugly
        and a bad attempt of breaking into an industry
        sector that was dying out anyway. The success of Discovery Channel shows about bike builders
        brought on this atrocity, but as I get older I see
        the Fury as a reliable, cheap way to get a tough
        looking bike, with the help of a hacksaw of course.
